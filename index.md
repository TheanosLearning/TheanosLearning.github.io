## Hey guys! I'm TensorFlow,

I enjoy playing Gears of War 4 Horde and developing hobby projects to enhance player experience. Most of my projects are in Javascript, which I learned by taking the _30 day Javascript challenge_.

### Extensions

Several projects are actually Chrome extensions. These can easily be installed from the Chrome Web Store.

### Works in Progress

**1. Gears Quest**

Project development will continue after [season 2](https://gearsofwar.com/en-us/community/news/announcing-gears-pro-circuit-season-2) launch (fall 2017) of the Gears Pro Circuit.

```javascript
var sidebar = document.getElementById('sidebar');
var quest = sidebar.querySelectorAll('[data-quest-id]')[0];
var rewardBtn = quest.querySelector('.reward .button');
// claim your quest reward!
rewardBtn.click();
```
**2. Color Blast Packs**

Making the pack opening experience more exciting by setting the glow animation on open instead of on hover.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TheanosLearning/TheanosLearning.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
